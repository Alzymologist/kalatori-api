  title: Kalatori — non-custodial Polkadot payments gateway
  description: |-
    Kalatori daemon API. Allows any compatible eCommerce plugin to create and monitor the payment status of its orders.

    Each order is used to derive a unique Polkadot address (using account derivation paths), which is used to map payment to the particular order ID.

  version: 2.0.0

paths:
  /v2/order/{orderId}:

      summary: Derive an address for the specified order, or check/update the status if it already exists
      description: |-
        This endpoint idempotently derives and address and initializes payment monitoring for the specified amount

        The request method is POST, so no intermediaries would be caching responses;
        `orderID` is included into the path to allow some http-proxy level manipulation, like adding a prefix for the specific shop on successful auth.

        All other parameters are passed in a JSON payload
      parameters:
        - name: orderId

                    Amount (in selected currency; denominated, **not** in Plancks) to be paid. After reaching this amount Kalatori will initiate a payout 
                    to the destination address and will report the order as paid to the shop.

                    This parameter can be skipped on subsequent requests, in which case the previous amount will be used.
                    If skipped in the original request, error 400 will be returned.
                  type: number
                  example: 17.99

                currency:

                    Currency (human-readable ticker, one of the values listed in the `/status::supported_currencies`) specifying the currency to wait for the payment in.

                    If no currency is specified, but `amount` is present, server will return error 400.
                  type: string
                  example: "USDC"

                callback:
                  description: |-
                    URL to be called when the order is paid.
                    The URL will receive a POST request with 'OrderStatus'-compliant JSON object on each transaction reaching (or leaving) this order's payment account.

                    If omitted in the initial request, there will be no callback URL set for the order.
                    If omitted in subsequent requests, the previous callback URL will be used; if the callback URL is different, the previous one will be replaced.
                    Set the callback URL to an empty string to remove the callback URL.
                  type: string
                  format: uri

        This endpoint is used by the shop admins to acknowledge the excessive/complicated payment
        and initiate a forceful full withdrawal (via `transferAll` or an analogous call) to the
        specified withdrawal address.

        The intention is to mark order as completed on Kalatori side, and then to handle the return manually
        from the withdrawal account.

        kind:
          type: string
          enum: [native, asset]
          description: |-
            Used to distinguish between "native" currencies (using the `balances` pallet) and assets (using the `assets` pallet).
        decimals:
          type: integer
          minimum: 0
          maximum: 20
          description: |-
            Number of decimal places in the currency. 
            Polkadot has 10, Kusama has 12; 20 is an arbitrarily-chosen upper bound which is not expected to be exceeded in the real world.
        rpc_url:
          type: string
          format: uri
          description: |-
            URL of the RPC endpoint to be used to query the balance of the currency, expected to be a WSS-enabled.
            Passed to the client-side JavaScript for frontend chain interactions (most importantly — for checking the balances and submitting the transactions).
        asset_id:
          type: integer
          description: |-
            ID of the asset in the `assets` pallet.
            Should not be provided iff `kind` is `"native"`.
      required:
        - currency
        - chain_name

      type: object
      properties:
        version:
          type: string
          description: |-
            Version of the daemon software.

            Expected to follow semver and be incremented on every release.
            Mostly useful when debugging issues with the daemon.
        instance_id:
          type: string
          description: |-
            Unique identifier of the running instance.
            Can be used to distinguish between different instances of the same daemon.

            Generated randomly (ideally — from a dictionary of words) at the first start of the daemon and recorded in the database
        debug:
          type: boolean
          description: |-
            Debug mode should be enabled when the daemon runs against a testnet (like Westend) or a local development chain (e.g. proxied via Chopsticks).

            This value is communicated to the client-side JavaScript and can be used to enable additional logging and debugging features.
        kalatori_remark:
          type: string
          description: |-
            Verbatim copy of the `KALATORI_REMARK` environment variable. Can be absent if the variable is not set.

      type: object
      properties:
        block_number:
          type: integer
          description: |-
            Block number of the transaction.
            Together with `position_in_block` should be used to uniquely identify the finalized transaction on the blockchain, e.g. for block explorers.
        position_in_block:
          type: integer
          description: |-
            Position of the transaction within the block.
            Together with `block_number` should be used to uniquely identify the finalized transaction on the blockchain, e.g. for block explorers.
        timestamp:
          type: string
          format: date-time
          description: Timestamp of the transaction as recorded in the block, in the ISO 8601 format.
        transaction_bytes:
          type: string
          format: hex
          description: |-
            Hex-encoded bytes of the transaction.

              enum: [all]
          description: |-
            Human-readable amount transferred in the transaction (not accounting for the transaction fees).
            Numeric value should be a _float_ denominated in the title currency (not in Plancks), `"all"` as a _string_ is passed if it's a `transferAll` or an analogous withdrawal.

        currency:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/CurrencyInfo'
        status:
          type: string
          enum: [pending, paid, failed]
          description: |-
            Status of the transaction.

            Should be `pending` if the transaction is not included in the chain yet (but had already been sent by the daemon).
            `finalized` only happens on the **successful** execution of the transaction, `failed` is used otherwise (or if the transaction fails some pre-flight checks)

            If transaction is `finalized`, `block_number` and `position_in_block` fields should be present.
